# Core Java – OOPS Practice

I started learning Object-Oriented Programming in Java on 28th February 2026.

This folder contains the programs I built while learning and practicing OOPS concepts.  
All the code here was written independently as part of my learning journey.

I focused on understanding the logic instead of memorizing syntax.

---

## What I Practiced

• Classes and Objects  
• Constructors  
• Encapsulation (private variables, getters & setters)  
• Business logic methods (deposit, withdraw, validation)  
• 2D Arrays  
• Nested loops  
• Structuring programs using multiple methods  
• Taking user input using Scanner

## Folder Structure

01-Encapsulation  
Basic programs to understand encapsulation and data hiding.

02-BankingSystem  
A simple bank account model with deposit and withdraw logic.

03-MarksSystem-Basic  
2D array based student marks system.

04-MarksSystem-Enhanced  
Improved version of marks system with better structure and data handling.

This repository represents the beginning of my structured Java learning phase.  
I am continuously improving and adding more advanced concepts.

More updates coming as I progress.
