# Core Java – OOP Practice

I started learning Object-Oriented Programming in Java on 28 February 2026.

This folder contains the programs I built while understanding and applying core OOP concepts.  
Every program here was written independently as part of my structured learning process.

Instead of memorizing syntax, I focused on understanding how real-world systems can be modeled using classes and objects.

## What I Practiced

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors (default & parameterized)  
- Encapsulation (private variables, getters & setters with validation)  
- Business logic methods (deposit, withdraw, result calculation)  
- 2D Arrays  
- Nested loops  
- Structuring programs using multiple methods  
- Taking user input using Scanner

## Folder Structure

### 01-Encapsulation
Programs focused on understanding data hiding and controlled access to class fields.

### 02-BankingSystem
A simple bank account model implementing deposit and withdrawal logic with validation.

### 03-MarksSystem-Basic
A student marks management system using 2D arrays and nested loops.

### 04-MarksSystem-Enhanced
An improved version of the marks system with better structure and cleaner logic separation.

### 05-Constructors
Practice programs covering constructor overloading and constructor chaining.

This folder represents the foundation phase of my Core Java journey.  
As I progress, I will continue adding more advanced topics such as polymorphism, abstraction, collections, and exception handling.

My goal is to build a strong backend-focused Java foundation.
