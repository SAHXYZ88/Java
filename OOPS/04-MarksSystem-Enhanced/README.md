# Enhanced Marks System

This is an improved version of the basic marks system.

In this version, I focused on:

- Cleaner structure
- Better logic separation
- More controlled data handling
- Improved overall design thinking

Instead of writing everything inside main(), I started organizing responsibilities inside classes properly.

This project reflects my progress in understanding how to design better structured programs.
