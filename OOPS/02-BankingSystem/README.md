# Basic Banking System

This project simulates a simple Banking System to apply OOP concepts in a real-world scenario.

Concepts implemented:

- Class and object creation
- Constructors
- Encapsulation
- Deposit and withdrawal logic
- Basic validation

Instead of writing isolated examples, I modeled a simple bank account with real operations like balance updates and transaction logic.

The purpose of this project was to move from theoretical OOP to practical system modeling.

This was my first attempt at thinking like a backend developer rather than just a Java learner.
