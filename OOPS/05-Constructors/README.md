# Constructor Practice (Overloading & Chaining)

This module focuses on understanding constructors deeply.

Concepts implemented:

- Default constructor
- Parameterized constructor
- Constructor overloading
- Constructor chaining using this()

Here I explored how objects are initialized in different ways and how multiple constructors can work together.

Understanding constructors properly helped me realize how object creation plays a critical role in system stability and flexibility.

This module strengthened my core OOP foundation significantly.
