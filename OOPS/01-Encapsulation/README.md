# Encapsulation Practice

This module focuses on understanding and implementing Encapsulation in Java.

Here I practiced:

- Making variables private
- Creating getters and setters
- Adding validation logic inside setters
- Preventing direct access to internal data

Instead of just defining a class with variables, I ensured that the data was protected and could only be accessed or modified through controlled methods.

This helped me understand:
Why data hiding is important,
How validation improves reliability,
And how real systems protect internal data.

Encapsulation was my first serious step into Object-Oriented Programming.
