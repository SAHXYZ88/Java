# Marks Management System (Basic Version)

This module represents my attempt to build a simple student marks management system.

Concepts used:

- 2D Arrays
- Nested loops
- Object-Oriented structure
- Constructor initialization
- Basic aggregation logic

Here I focused on combining arrays with OOP instead of treating them separately.

The system allows storing marks for multiple students and subjects, and calculating basic results.

This project helped me understand how structured logic works inside real academic systems.
