# Java OOP Learning Journey

I started this repository on 28 February 2026 to build a strong and disciplined foundation in Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming.

This is not just a collection of practice programs.  
It represents my step-by-step learning process where I focused on understanding concepts deeply and applying them by building small structured systems.

Instead of writing random examples, I created practical implementations such as:

- Banking Systems  
- Student Marks Management Systems  
- Constructor-based object modeling  
- Encapsulation with validation logic  

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Strengthen my Core Java fundamentals  
- Understand OOP concepts clearly and practically  
- Think in terms of systems instead of isolated code snippets  
- Prepare myself for backend development  

Every folder inside the OOPS directory represents a concept I learned and implemented with intention.

I believe strong fundamentals create strong engineers — and this repository reflects that mindset.
